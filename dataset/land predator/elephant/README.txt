README

This data file is published by the Movebank Data Repository (www.datarepository.movebank.org). As of the time of publication, a version of this published animal tracking dataset can be viewed on Movebank (www.movebank.org) in the study "African elephants in Etosha National Park (data from Tsalyuk et al. 2018)" (Movebank Study ID 605129389). Individual attributes in the data files are defined below and in the Movebank Attribute Dictionary, available at www.movebank.org/node/2381.

This dataset was randomly sub-sampled to include 7.4% of the original data set to mask fine-scale movements of this threatened species. Please contact the data owner at wgetz@berkeley.edu for the full dataset. In addition, a different (1-hourly) subsample of 8 of the elephants in this dataset were previously published in Abrahms et al. (2017).

This data package includes the following data files:
African elephants in Etosha National Park (data from Tsalyuk et al. 2018).csv
African elephants in Etosha National Park (data from Tsalyuk et al. 2018)-reference-data.csv

These data are described in the following written publication:
Tsalyuk M, Kilian W, Reineking B, Marcus W (2018) Temporal variation in resource selection of African elephants follows long term variability in resource availability. Ecological Monographs. doi:10.1002/ecm.1348

Data Attributes
These definitions come from the Movebank Attribute Dictionary, available at www.movebank.org/node/2381.

animal ID: An individual identifier for the animal, provided by the data owner. This identifier can be a ring number, a name, the same as the associated tag ID, etc. If the data owner does not provide an Animal ID, an internal Movebank animal identifier may sometimes be shown.
	example: 91876A, Gary
	same as: individual-local-identifier

animal life stage: The age class or life stage of the animal at the beginning of the deployment. Can be years or months of age or terms such as "adult", "subadult" and "juvenile". Units should be defined in the values (e.g. "2 years").
	example: juvenile, adult
	units: Any units should be defined in the remarks.

attachment type: The way a tag is attached to an animal. Values are chosen from a controlled list:
	collar: The tag is attached by a collar around the animal's neck.
	glue: The tag is attached to the animal using glue.
	harness: The tag is attached to the animal using a harness.
	implant: The tag is placed under the skin of the an animal.
	tape: The tag is attached to the animal using tape.
	other: user specified

beacon frequency: The frequency of the radio tag or tag retrieval beacon.
	example: 450.5
	units: MHz
	same as: tag beacon frequency

deploy off timestamp: The timestamp when the tag deployment ended.
	example: 2009-10-01 12:00:00.000
	format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.sss
	units: UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) or GPS time, which is a few leap seconds different from UTC
	same as: deploy off date

deploy on latitude: The geographic latitude of the location where the animal was released (intended primarily for instances in which the animal release and tag retrieval locations have higher accuracy than those derived from sensor data).
	example: 27.3516
	units: decimal degrees, WGS84 reference system

deploy on longitude: The geographic longitude of the location where the animal was released (intended primarily for instances in which the animal release and tag retrieval locations have higher accuracy than those derived from sensor data).
	example: -97.3321
	units: decimal degrees, WGS84 reference system

deploy on timestamp: The timestamp when the tag deployment started.
	example: 2008-08-30 18:00:00.000
	format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.sss
	units: UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) or GPS time, which is a few leap seconds different from UTC
	same as: deploy on date

deployment comments: Additional information about the tag deployment that is not described by other reference data terms.
	example: This deployment was excluded from analysis because the tag failed.

deployment ID: A unique identifier for the deployment of a tag on animal, provided by the data owner. If the data owner does not provide a Deployment ID, an internal Movebank deployment identifier may sometimes be shown.
	example: Jane-Tag42

event ID: An identifier for the set of information associated with each record or event in a data set. A unique event ID is assigned to every time-location or other time-measurement record in Movebank.
	example: 6340565
	units: none

latitude (decimal degree): The geographic longitude of a location along an animal track as estimated by the processed sensor data. Positive values are east of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are west of it.
	example: -121.1761111
	units: decimal degrees, WGS84 reference system
	same as: location lat

	phone network: Data are transferred via a phone network, such as GSM or AMPS.
	other wireless: Data are transferred via another form of wireless data transfer, such as a VHF radio transmitter/receiver.
	tag retrieval: The tag must be physically retrieved in order to obtain the data.

taxon: The scientific name of the species on which the tag was deployed, as defined by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS, www.itis.gov). If the species name can not be provided, this should be the lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined and that is used in the ITIS taxonomy. Additional information can be provided using the term taxon detail.

timestamp: The date and time a sensor measurement was taken.
